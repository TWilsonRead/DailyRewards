+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This plugin was designed by Westbourne - specifically for Mistylands (Server IP: Mistylands.net).
Do not change the number of lines in this file, the plugin requires the information in specific places.
Please only change the information after the colon (:) on each line.
Do not put extra leading/trailing spaces before/after your entries. (1 space only between : and YourEntry).
Type must be one of the three types: ITEM, COMMAND_CRATEKEY or ECONOMY.
If Type is ITEM, Item should be one of the items on the bukkit Materials webpage (see top of this page).
If Type is COMMAND_CRATEKEY, Item should be the first part of the command (before the playername).
If Type is ECONOMY, Item should be the amount of money you want to give the player.
Amount should be an integer only, in all cases.
If your crate key syntax is not supported by the above limitations, let me know and I will sort it for you.
Description should be a short description (string).
This is one of the first plugins I have created and is no where near perfect, however a lot of time and 
effort has been put in to make sure there are as little bugs as possible.
Further functionality may be added in the future depending on the demand of users.
Chat messages, including the colours, may be customisable in future updates.
Error messages have been added, which will be available in your server's console if things go wrong.
Please check these errors to make sure your syntax of this file is correct before messaging.
If you identify a critical bug, have any suggestions, or have a query, please messsage me on Discord at 
Westbourne#6012.
